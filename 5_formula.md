### 1. **Bash (Bourne Again Shell)**
Bash is a Unix shell and command language. It is widely available on various operating systems and is the default shell on most Linux distributions. Bash scripts are used for automating tasks.

### 2. **`grep`**
`grep` is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular expression. In this script, `grep` is used to find lines containing the phrase "skipping servicemonitor" in the log files.

### 3. **`date`**
The `date` command is used to display or set the system date and time. In this script, it is used to:
   - Calculate the timestamp for one day ago.
   - Convert log dates to epoch time for comparison.

### 4. **Regular Expressions**
Regular expressions (regex) are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In this script, regex is used within `grep` and `if` statements to extract timestamps and `servicemonitor` names from log entries.

### 5. **Pipelines and Redirection**
Pipelines (`|`) and redirection (`>`, `<`) are used to pass the output of one command as input to another. In this script:
   - `|` is used to pass the output of `grep` to a `while read` loop.
   - `| sort | uniq` is used to sort the output and remove duplicate entries.

### Script Breakdown
- **Defining Log File Paths**: The script starts by defining the paths to the log files.
- **Function `extract_servicemonitor`**: This function processes each log file to extract relevant `servicemonitor` entries from the past day.
  - **`grep`**: Searches for lines containing "skipping servicemonitor".
  - **Regex Matching**: Extracts timestamps and `servicemonitor` names.
  - **Date Comparison**: Converts dates to epoch time and compares them to the timestamp for one day ago.
  - **Output Formatting**: Formats and prints the results.
- **Displaying Results**: The script calls the function for each log file and displays the results.

- Powershell Version

Here's the PowerShell version of your script:

```powershell
# Define an array of log file paths for WSL
$logFilePaths = @(
    "C:\Users\rifat.sahin\Downloads\main.log"
    "C:\Users\rifat.sahin\Downloads\sublog1.log"
    "C:\Users\rifat.sahin\Downloads\sublog2.log"
    "C:\Users\rifat.sahin\Downloads\sublog3.log"
)

# Function to extract and display metadata entries with log file names and dates
# mymetadata is any unique text that is log line based unique
function Extract-Metadata {
    param (
        [string]$logFilePath
    )
    $oneDayAgo = (Get-Date).AddDays(-1)
    Get-Content $logFilePath | ForEach-Object {
        if ($_ -match "ts=([0-9T:-]+)") {
            $logDate = $matches[1]
            $logDateEpoch = [datetime]::Parse($logDate)
            if ($logDateEpoch -ge $oneDayAgo) {
                if ($_ -match "my=([^/]+)") {
                    $mymetadata = $matches[1]
                    Write-Output "logfile=$(Split-Path $logFilePath -Leaf) logdate=$logDate mymetadata=$mymetadata"
                }
            }
        }
    } | Sort-Object | Get-Unique
}

# Display results for each log file
foreach ($logFilePath in $logFilePaths) {
    Write-Output "Results for $(Split-Path $logFilePath -Leaf):"
    Extract-Metadata -logFilePath $logFilePath
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Path Adjustments**: Converted paths to Windows format.
2. **Date Handling**: Used PowerShell's date handling functions.
3. **Content Reading**: Used `Get-Content` to read the log files.
4. **Output Formatting**: Used `Write-Output` for displaying results.

This PowerShell script should perform the same tasks as your original Bash script. If you need any further adjustments or run into any issues, feel free to ask!
